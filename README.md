# l2c -- Learn to Code
This repository contains resources for the coding cohort.

## Instructions

Make a [github account](https://github.com/ "github")

Github is a version control system and the primary way that we'll share code with each other.

Accept Slack invite, make an account and join the channel ( if you have not received an invite, let me know).

Slack will be the primary way that we communicate with each other.

Ensure that you have Python 2.7.9 as well as pip installed.
+ Python version can be checked by opening the terminal and running ```python --version```
+ pip can be check similarly by running ```pip --version```
+ There is a good chance your mac came installed with python, in which case the above will work, if not: follow instructions [here](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/)
