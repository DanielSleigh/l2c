# l2c -- Learn to Code
This repository contains resources for the coding cohort.

## Goals
I recognize that a variety of different goals exist within the group.  If you have not already, please communicate your specific goals to me so that we can try and achieve them (particularly if they are not reprsented below).  Here are some themes that have emerged so far:

+ A reasonable understanding about how enjoyable the activity of coding is and whether you'd like to continue learning more. 
+ A higher level of tech literacy and a better understanding of how startups work.
+ Being able to solve a paricular computer problem such as automating mundane tasks, scraping a website for data or making a website.

We should collectively revisit goals in the future once we can gauge a longer term level of interest from people to make sure we are providing the right value to people who continue to be interested.

## Methodology

We'll begin with an in-person crash course overview of things. The outline for that workshop will be in a workshop0 folder.  If there is interest in future workshops, outlines for them will also be in this repo.

One of the outcomes of the in-person workshop will be an introduction to a project management system called Jira. We will use this system to track the work we are doing.  Additional work an assigments will be communicated through this tool.  This will allow the majority of work to take place remotely and in a very similar style to how start ups work.

Ideally, I'd like to have a short once a week meeting via google hangout to allow people to quickly tell others what they're working on, whether they need help with anything and communicate any other issues they are having.  If we can't find a mutually agreeable time, we may just need to do this more adhoc. The majority of communication should be through the slack channel and comments on code during code review, but it's still just nice sometimes to be able to talk rather than type about things.  


## Instructions

+ Make a [github account](https://github.com/ "github")

  Github is a version control system and the primary way that we'll share code with each other.

+ Accept Slack invite, make an account and join the channel ( if you have not received an invite, let me know).

  Slack will be the primary way that we communicate with each other.

+ Install a good text editor. 

  If you think its highly likely that you'll be really into this, then it might be worth trying to learn a really powerful editor like Vim or Emacs.  Both have strong proponents.  I'd recommend Vim simply because its what I use and could help you with and the most compelling argument about which editor to use that i've heard is to use the one's your friends and co-workers use. On a mac this should already be installed and can be opened from the terminal with ```vim```

  [a tutorial that i haven't tried, google might produce other better ones, not sure](http://www.openvim.com/)

  However, that being said, most of you probably shouldn't dive in to using vim.  If you think the chances are relatively low that you'll end up wanting to be a developer or otherwise want to get super awesome at text manipluation, then you'd be better off with an editor like [sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/). 

  There are many choices, so if you don't like something that you try, its totally fine to try another.

+ Ensure that you have Python 2.7.9 as well as pip installed.
  + Python version can be checked by opening the terminal and running ```python --version```
  + pip can be check similarly by running ```pip --version```
  + There is a good chance your mac came installed with python, in which case the above will work, if not: follow instructions [here](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/)
