# Introduction

# The Command Line 

## Grammar and Syntax

```bash
verb -adjective -adjective noun noun
```

Adjectives are typically optional

First noun is generally the source of a command
Second noun is usually the target of a command

Sometimes you only use verbs, or one noun, it varies.

---

# The Command Line 

## Basic


```bash
cd /absolute/path/you/want 
cd relative/path/you/want
```
-- change directory  

```bash
ls
ls path/you/want
```
-- look stuff?

```bash
man cd
man ls
```
-- manual / help

```bash
pwd
```
-- present working directory

---

# The Command Line 

## Basic II

```bash
mkdir new_folder
mkdir much_cooler_name_than_new_folder
```
-- make directory
```bash
rm stupid_file_i_dont_need_anymore 
```
-- remove something
```bash
wc
```
-- word count 
```bash
head
```
-- print first bit of something 

---

# The Command Line 

## Basic III

```bash
tail
```
-- print last bit of something 

```bash
cp
```
-- copy something 

```bash
mv
```
-- move something 

---
# The Command Line
## Intermediate

```bash
grep -r 'text you need  to find' .
```
-- search for text

The pipe operator 
```bash
|
```
allows you to chain commands together, to pipe the output of one command to another

```bash
ls file_location | wc -l
grep -r '2015-08-24' . | head
```

```bash
sudo mdkir /some/root/level/permissions/directory
sudo su
```
-- run as a command as super user or become super user

---

# Version Control 

Workflow
```bash
git pull
```
Get most up to date version of the code
Then make changes to the code that you want to 

```bash
git status
git add .
git commit
git push
```

Submit Pull Request
Tag your reviewer with @their_github_handle
